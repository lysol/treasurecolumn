================

This is the code that runs [Treasure Column](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNW6jeGUfPUg_UsyAsTaPA), a Youtube bot I run
that harvests publicly available imagery and sets it to the finest in uptempo dance music.

More info on the project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@derekarnold/remote-viewing-5cb161cdef4a).

Requirements: See setup.py, but you'll also need a Wordnik API key, as well as Google credentials.
Default search path for credential files is the current directory. You must copy the config defaults file and put in your
Wordnik API key. It'll search `(cwd)/config.ini` and `~/.treasurecolumn/config.ini` for a config file.

You'll also need a url or file with a url on each line pointing at MJPEG streams. Obtaining those is 𝔞𝔫 𝔢𝔵𝔢𝔯𝔠𝔦𝔰𝔢 𝔩𝔢𝔣𝔱 𝔱𝔬 𝔱𝔥𝔢 𝔯𝔢𝔞𝔡𝔢𝔯.

Update:

Google APIs have shifted, as they do, so this is probably significantly broken. The rest of the code should still work,
if you'd like to generate these sorts of videos still.

Usage
--------

After installing via ye old setup.py, issue this command: 

    python -m treasurecolumn.bot -r 14 -f 2 -d -U urls.txt

Of course you, you can run `python -m treasurecolumn.bot --help` for help.
